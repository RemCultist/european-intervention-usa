  USA_european_intervention_act_desc: "The European Intervention Act recognizes the need for the abandonment of isolationist policies, based on recent history. The current crisis in Europe, alongside the First World War, evidence that Europe is in need of outside help to maintain a lasting peace. Through this act, perhaps we can set the stage for a democratic Europe, guarded against extremism from all sides."

  USA_the_german_crisis_desc: "Our first order of business - present to Congress a resolution to deal with the German Crisis that is sweeping across the face of Europe. The Germans have clearly been the aggressors of the past two major global conflicts, but no longer. We Americans play a vital role in the global security of our world, one that we have been shirking since our nation began. No longer shall this be the case. Towards a brighter future!"

  bkhmi_usa.1.t: "Americans Propose "European Plan""
  bkhmi_usa.1.d: "The Americans have proposed a thinly-veiled attempt at keeping a lasting peace in Europe and named it the "European Plan." This plan seems to be based around an alliance with us and a quick stab at either the Iberian Peninsula or at the French, in order to establish a dominant presence on the continent. This is dangerous talk, but perhaps it might be to our benefit..?"
  bkhmi_usa.1.a: "With hesitation, we accept."

  bkhmi_usa.2.t: "The United Kingdom Rejects the "European Plan""
  bkhmi_usa.2.d.a: "The United Kingdom has rejected a plan proposed by the United States of America to form an alliance with the intent of securing a "lasting peace in Europe." It is rumored the American proposal contained a secret article suggesting a sort of "readministration via diplomatic, or other, means" of several European countries. What this means for the future of Anglo-American relations is yet to be seen."
  bkhmi_usa.2.d.b: "A new danger looms over Europe - an Anglo-American alliance, signified by the acceptance of the "European Plan", proposed by the Americans and accepted by the British, whose goal is a vaguely worded "effort to create a lasting peace upon the continent of Europe, via international intervention." What this means for the future of Europe is uncertain, but let us hope we do not descend into a third World War as result."
  bkhmi_usa.2.a: "Towards a brighter future!"
  bkhmi_usa.2.b: "Let's hope this was worth the while..."

  USA_the_iberian_foothold: "The Iberian Foothold"
  USA_the_iberian_foothold_desc: "Though France is a volatile nation, perhaps we should turn our attention to Spain and Portugal, instead. Removing the threat to Gibraltar would cement our control of the Mediterranean, with the British holding onto the Suez to the east."
